The lineage graph provides a visual representation of data lineage information. Navigating this graph, users can get a better understanding of the interrelationships between tables and navigate between them.
The lineage graph at the top shows all tables, this will help you to understand the connections in the whole system.

It can be hard to read if you have a specific table in mind, thats why there is another window.
The bottom graph only shows you the selected node and its neighbours, neighbour in this case means dependency, so you can see only the important nodes. 
By clicking [glyph expand] You can increase the range of neighbours. 
For decreasing you have to click [glyph minimize].
